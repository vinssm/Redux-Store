# Redux-Store

### Description
- Refactor the e-commerce platform from the module project so that it uses Redux

### User Story
- AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
- I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
- SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem 

### Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state
- WHEN I review the appâ€™s store
- THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
- WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store
- THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider
- WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state
- THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
- WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store
- THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
- WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions
- THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
